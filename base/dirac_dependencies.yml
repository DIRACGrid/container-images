# This yaml file contains the list of DIRAC dependencies that must be satisfied
# even if we won't need it. For example, gfal2 needs to be installed in order to
# be able to install DIRAC, even in the services.
# These dependencies are separated from the main environment.yml in the hope that
# we can one day remove entirely this file
